# Challenge-5
For this challenge we used third-party API's in order to create a functioning calendar that lets any user save events for each hour of the day
and is powered by jQuery. With this calendar people should be able add any important events and manage there time effectively.

I wanted to create this repository in order to get better at javascript using API's and learn how to properly link java and html without having issues and how to
be better at using "if" statments.
